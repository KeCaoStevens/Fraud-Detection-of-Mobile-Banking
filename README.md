# Fraud-Detection-of-Mobile-Banking
The intrinsically private nature of financial
transactions leads to few publicly available
datasets, specially in the emerging mobile
money transactions domain.
The main challenge of fraud prediction is
the highly imbalanced distribution between positive
and negative classes.
Due to the imbalanced nature of fraud detection datasets, we
attempt to use under-sampling or over-sampling methods to
come up with a suitable approach for real-world problems.
